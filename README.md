 A remake of the popular website 'PCPartPicker' allows users to pick individual parts
to build a custom gaming computer and see the total cost in real-time. The selected
parts list can be saved to Local Storage for future reference. The application offers
an easy and efficient way to plan and budget custom gaming computer builds.
